The next step would be setup the kali VM I usally select 64bit and will be using vituralbox to launch the VM.

Now open up whatever virtual platform your running configure the propritate setting to launch the Kali VM that you just dowmloaded. Use Kali for both username and password to make it simple.

side not make sure before you launch the VM to go advanced settings and set the copy and paste function to Bidrectional. you will need this function enabled later on.
